# s3_backups

This is a project that allows you to specify a set of folders and optionally a mysql database to be backed up to AWS S3. This project includes unit tests, and a plugin for nagios.

## Installation

This project can be directly cloned onto the target machine, then can be setup to run automatically through cron.

## Configuration

s3_backups takes a yaml configuration file. By default, the configuration is loaded from the 'config.yml' in same directory the application is installed into. Optionally, you can pass in the path to another config. There is a sample configuration provided as 'config.yml.sample'.

## Usage

The 'backup_to_s3.py' script does not require any arguments, but will optionally accept the path to a configuration file.
eg:  
`$ backup_to_s3.py /path/to.config`
